# CopyPad
A clipboard history app for macOS. Inspired by the clipboard history app on Windows (one of the few things they got right)

CopyPad saves anything you copy so you can find it later. It does not persist any coppied items between computer restarts.


## FEATURES:

### KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
- Configure any two key combination to open a floating version of CopyPad
- Similar to the floating clipboard history that comes with Windows
- Click the :gear: -> "Keyboard Shortcuts" to configure it

### FOATING WINDOW
- CopyPad can display itself as a floating window (like SpotLight search)
- it will reveal itself when the key combination that you configured is pressed
- it will disapear if you click anywhere else, or if you press the escape key

### TEXT SEARCH:
- Fast text search of all items in CopyPad

### PREVIEWS:
- Double click an Item to preview. Works with text, images and files. Links are automatically detected and a hyperlink is created
